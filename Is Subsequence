Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting 
some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not)

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
       int n= s.size();
       int m= t.size();
       
       int j=0;
       
       for(int i=0; i<m and j<n; i++){
          if(s[j]==t[i])
            j++;
       }
       return (j==n);
     }
    };
